Below are some tips and tricks that I have picked up along my R journey, that may (or may not!) be useful for those working with sport science data, or any data, in R. I hope you find the tips useful!

## Visualising Netball Data

If you are interested in working with some real life netball data, you can see a slidedeck that I put together of how to import, tidy and analyse the data [here.](https://sportstatisticsrsweet.github.io/RNetball/Slides)

## Working with Files from Drobpbox

Sometimes, someone will share some data with us via Dropbox. Often these files can be **really** big and it is annoying to download a local copy of these files on your machine. If you have been sent a link to view these files, the following may be useful so you can load them directly into R, without having to save the file locally on your machine first.

1. Get "Share (or Copy) Dropbox Link" from file.
  This might look like: https://www.dropbox.com/s/sometexthere/NameOfFile.csv?dl=0
2. Change dl=0 to dl=1 at end of link.
  This might look like: https://www.dropbox.com/s/sometexthere/NameOfFile.csv?dl=1
3. Run the following code
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Install the {vroom} package
install.packages(vroom)
# Load the package from your library
library(vroom)
# Load your data directly into R!
data <- vroom("https://www.dropbox.com/s/sometexthere/NameOfFile.csv?dl=1")
```

## Quickly importing Athlete Management System (AMS) Data into R

Use R to quickly import AMS your data and not even open a web browser! To do this, please follow the steps below. Note â€“ I am using Smartabase as an example here because it is familiar to me. 

1. Save a report of your data within Smartabase. For example, save a report that contains all historical athlete wellness data.
2. Open R and use the code below to import your data. Note, you will need to add your own username/ password/ URL details that are specific to your team.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Load required packages
library(rvest)
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
library(qdap)
# Connect to a report that you have generated via Smartabase
WellnessDataURL <- html_session("https://username:password@my2.smartabase.com/yourteamsname/live?report=WellnessData&updategroup=true")
# Read in data
WellnessData <- read_html(WellnessDataURL)
# Identify the table
WellnessDataTable <- html_nodes(WellnessData, "table")
# Collect only table data
WellnessDataTable1 <- html_table(WellnessDataTable[1], fill = TRUE)
# Make data.frame
HistoricalWellnessData <- as.data.frame(WellnessDataTable1)
# Clean Environment
rm(list = grep("^HistoricalWellnessData", ls(), value = TRUE, invert = TRUE))
```

Now your AMS data is in a neat data.frame and ready for any further statistical analysis or visualisation using R, without needing to open a web browser!
