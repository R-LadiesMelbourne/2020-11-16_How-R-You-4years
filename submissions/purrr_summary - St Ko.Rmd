title: "Using purrr for quick summary tables"

Adapted from this fantasic [Learn to Purrr tutorial](http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-19_purrr/)

```{r}
# Load example data
data("mtcars")

head(mtcars)
```

You can use `purrr` to loop over all the columns, and output the info into a dataframe.

In this example, I want to see variable type, max character length, and missingness.
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # Includes purrr

# Create dataframe with some summary info
summary_df <- mtcars %>%
  purrr::map_df(
    ~data.frame(
      class = class(.x),
      max_char = max(nchar(.x, keepNA = FALSE)),
      missing = sum(is.na(.x))
    ), .id ="col_name"
  )

summary_df
```

And because it's a dataframe, you can use a package like `kableExtra` to format it for reports.
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(kableExtra)

summary_df %>%
  kableExtra::kbl() %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```
